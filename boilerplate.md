# React Router Boilerplate

This is node_babel_react + react router.
Specifically we use `react-router-dom` which uses `react-router`.

TODO: explore bundle splitting using routes.

- Cleaned up `src/boilerplate` after merging react-master.
- Not sure if the division between `<Router>` and `<Switch>`
  in `src/boilerplate/{index.js,boilerplate.js}` is the best way to be doing things.
